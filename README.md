## User Experience (UX)

* ### User Stories

    * __First Time Visitor Goals__

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to navigate through the website with ease to find the content.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand the main purpose of the website and learn more about the gym and its message.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to know what other people’s previous experiences are of attending this gym and to easily find social links to keep up to date with news about the gym.

    * __Returning Visitor Goals__

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about the gym classes and schedules.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to contact the gym easily and in the best way possible.

* ### Design

    * __Colour Scheme__

        * The main colours used are dark navy blue, orange, and white.

    * __Typography__

        * The two main fonts used for the website are Anton and Lato. Anton has a distinctively energetic character and stands out, which is fitting for a website about a gym. The Lato font is very clean and widely used among programmers, so it is very fitting as well as attractive.

    * __Imagery__

        * The imagery is essential. The large hero image on the homepage is designed to appear both eye-catching, motivating and purposeful.

<br>

## Features

__Existing Features__

* __Navigation Bar__

    * Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, Classes, Contact Log In page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
    * This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page.
    * The navigation bar will turn into a toggler when the device is the size of a tablet or smaller.
        This will make it easier for users to navigate through the page, as well as visually more attractive on smaller devices.

<br>

* __The Hero Image__

    * The Hero image includes a photo with a text overlay to provide the user with some extra motivation.
    * The Hero image section introduces the user to Dolly's Dojo with an energetic, motivating image to get their attention.

<br>

* __User Review Section__

    * In the User Review section, the user will find the reviews of members who are frequent attenders of the gym and what they have experienced of Dolly's Dojo so far. 
    * The positive tones of the reviews will make the user awaken their own enthousiasm and courage to give Dolly's Dojo a try.

<br>

* __The Footer__

    * The footer section consists of three items: the name of the website, the copyright and links to the relevant social media sites for Dolly's Dojo. 
        The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
    * The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media.
    * The footer contains the same design as the navigation bar. It gives the user a sense of consistency and aethetic.
    * When viewed on tablet sized devices or smaller, the footer will collapse and stack the website, copyright and the social links on each other.
        This way, there is no overlap between the items and the user will still have a neat overview of the footer items.

<br>

* __Classes Page__

    * The Classes page will show the user what different classes Dolly's Dojo has to offer.
    * This way, the user can get a preview even before attending the gym itself. 
        It will give the user some inside information, which will help them encourage to join the gym.

<br>

* __Contact Page__

    * In the Contact Page, users can get in touch with Dolly's Dojo by filling out the contact form.
    * The users will find they have to fill in every aspect (except for the comments area) to submit the form.
        This is to prevent submitting an empty form.
    * Once the form is filled in and the user clicks on the "Contact Us!" button, the user will be directed to a page with a feedback message.
    * When viewed on mobile devices, the input fields are designed to reduce in length but still be long enough for the user to fill in.
    
 * __Thanks Page__

    * Once the user submits a Contact form, they will be directed to a page with a nice and clear thank you message.
    * This will give the user both a satisfying feeling of successfully filling in the form, and give them feedback on their actions.

<br>

 __Possible Future Features__

* The website could be improved by adding a feature for a webshop for Dolly's Dojo products. 
By adding this feature, users can get appropriate and safe fitness gear to attend the gym, the group classes or gym at home if they wish.

* Another feature that could improve the website is adding online group classes.
By adding this feature, users can attend the gym from their own home and stay as fit as ever. The users could attend a virtual class with instructors giving live classes.

* A third feature for improvement is a login page for existing members to get access to their own account.

__Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section__

* __First Time Visitor Goals__

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to navigate through the website with ease to find the content.

        * The site has been designed to be fluid. The navigation bar is sticky, therefore it will scroll down along with the scrollbar as the user finds out more about the page. They will be able to get to the desired page within seconds, at any given moment.
        * On the Contact Us page, after the form is submitted, the user will find themselves on a new page with a message. The navigation bar is still present and they can get back to any page by clicking on the link.

    <h2 align="center">
    <img src="docs/screenshots/navigation-bar.PNG" alt="navbar" style="max-width:100%;">
    </h2>
    
    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to understand the main purpose of the website and learn more about the gym and its message.

        * When entering the site, users are greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to get to the page of their choice. Underneath the navigation bar users will find the hero image with a text overlay “Dolly’s Dojo – The gym for everyone!”.
        * The main purpose of the website is immediately found within the hero image and text overlay.
        * The user has to either scroll down the page to find out more about the website, or use the navigation bar and click on the pages they want to see.

    <h2 align="center">
    <img src="docs/screenshots/hero-image-text-overlay.PNG" alt="hero image" style="max-width:100%;">
    </h2>

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to know what other people’s previous experiences are of attending this gym and to easily find social links to keep up to date with news about the gym.

        * On the homepage, if users scroll down below the hero image, they will find a section with User Reviews. In this section, users can find out what people’s previous experiences with this gym are, and determine whether they would like to find out more.
        * On the right bottom of each page, the user will find some links for social media platforms that the gym is making use of.
        * The social media include Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Youtube accounts for the gym.
        * The social links will open up in a new tab, so users can easily get back to the page for the gym.
    
    <h2 align="center">

    </h2>

<br>

* __Returning Visitor Goals__

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information about the gym classes and schedules.

        * If the user clicks on the Classes in the navigation bar, they will be directed to a page where the gym's group classes are viewed.
        * Users can find out more about the gym and the procedures for the classes.
        * If the user scroll down, they will find six images with the class names and information about the classes.

    <h2 align="center">
    <img src="docs/screenshots/classes-text.PNG" alt="footer" style="max-width:100%;">
    </h2>

    <h2 align="center">
    <img src="docs/screenshots/classes-2.PNG" alt="footer" style="max-width:100%;">
    </h2>

    2.  As a Returning Visitor, I want to be able to contact the gym easily and in the best way possible.

        * The navigation bar highlights the Contact Page.
        * On the Contact Page, users can fill out a form to get in touch with the gym. This way, they will have more direct communication with the creators of the gym and have more opportunity to get information.
        * On the bottom of each page, the user will find the footer bar where a website and the links for social platform accounts can be found. Users can also contact the gym by means of social media.
        * Once users submit the Contact form, they are greeted with a nice and clean thank you message as a confirmation.
        * After submitting, users can choose to navigate through the website once again, by clicking the links on the navigation bar.

    <h2 align="center">
    <img src="docs/screenshots/contact-page.PNG" alt="footer" style="max-width:100%;">
    </h2>

<br>

## Known Bugs

* In the Contact form, when the user picks a country code for their mobile phone number, the country name does not reduce in size when viewed on mobile devices.
The validation check mark will appear right over the name of the country, making it slightly less legible.

<br>

## Fixed Bugs

* When the Contact Us button in the Contact form is submitted, the user would be directed to the Contact page once again. 
This is fixed and the user will now be directed to a page with a feedback message.
* The input field for the Mobile phone number in the Contact form had two separate fields, one for selecting country dialling code and one for entering the digits. 
This has been fixed and they are now merged into one field where the user can choose their country code and enter their phone digits.
